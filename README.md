## Project Overview

As part of my learning journey in data analytics and business intelligence, I developed an interactive **HR Analytics Dashboard** using **Microsoft Power BI**.  
The goal of this project was to analyze employee attrition patterns, identify key influencing factors, and provide actionable insights that can support HR decision-making.

The dashboard enables organizations to better understand workforce trends, identify high-risk attrition segments, and design data-driven retention strategies.
